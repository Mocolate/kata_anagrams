# kata_anagrams
A repository to save the anagrams kata to. This kata will be used to practice pair programming, TDD and proper committing to github.

# The Kata
Given a file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations of words that are anagrams; each line in the output contains all the words from the input that are anagrams of each other. For example, your program might include in its output:

1. kinship pinkish
2. enlist inlets listen silent
3. boaster boaters borates
4. fresher refresh
5. sinks skins
6. knits stink
7. rots sort


If you run this on the word list here you should find 20683 sets of anagrams (a total of 48162 words), including all-time favorites such as

1. crepitus cuprites pictures piecrust
2. paste pates peats septa spate tapes tepas
3. punctilio unpolitic
4. sunders undress


For added programming pleasure, find the longest words that are anagrams, and find the set of anagrams containing the most words (so “parsley players replays sparely” would not win, having only four words in the set).
